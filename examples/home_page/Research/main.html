<h1>Research</h1>

<p>
In 1819, Ørsted discovered the deflection of 
a compass needle while performing a demonstration for 
his students. This discovery of a fundamental 
connection between electricity and magnetism rocked 
the scientific community and led to a flurry of activity 
in electrodynamic research by such investigators as Ampère and Arago. 
After all, the magnetism produced by a current would generate a force. 
Forces are capable of producing motion, so motion could come about 
which would lead to a current. While this is not a conservation law, 
it is a statement about the fundamental interconvertibility 
of natural phenomena. 

<p>
It it is often stated that Ørsted's was completely 
accidental and spontaneous. That contention is, however, 
misleading. Oersted had studied Naturphilosophie under 
Schelling himself, and wholeheartedly adopted the 
view that nature is systematic and unified. 
(He also thought that the practice of science is a religion.) 
The fact that he should be seeking a connection between 
electricity and magnetism was motivated entirely because of 
his prior philosophical conviction that one must exist. 
After all, only someone looking to find a connection between 
electricity and magnetism would consider placing a compass, 
only affected by magnetic fields, near a current-carrying wire, 
thought to be a purely electrical phenomenon, in the first place. 

<p>
Ørsted's experiment showed that there were underlying connections 
between what appeared to be quite different physical 
phenomena, and encouraged other scientists to seek them out. 
While universal convertibility is not the same as conservation, 
the two are nonetheless closely related. 
Thus, a connection or conversion between different phenomena, 
especially two as outwardly dissimilar as electricity and 
magnetism, was step towards a unified concept of energy.
