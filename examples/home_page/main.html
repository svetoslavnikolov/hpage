<ul>
Danish physicist and philosopher who, in 1819, 
discovered the deflection of a compass needle 
while performing a demonstration for his students. 
This discovery of a fundamental connection between electricity 
and magnetism rocked the scientific community and 
led to a flurry of activity in electrodynamic research by 
such investigators as Ampère and Arago. 
After all, the magnetism produced by a current would generate a force. 
Forces are capable of producing motion, so motion could 
come about which would lead to a current. 
While this is not a conservation law, 
it is a statement about the fundamental interconvertibility 
of natural phenomena.
