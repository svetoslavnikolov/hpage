This tutorial is intended to all who
would like to create web sites fast and
easy. The web site is created using
the program H-PaGe.

<p><br>
The basic idea of the program is that
the user should write only the content,
and the looks of the site will be automatically
generated by the program.

<h2>Goal of this tutorial</h2>
The goal of this tutorial is to show step-by-step
how to make a page like this one.
<p><br>

You do not have to follow this tutorial. If you are
a hacker by heart, you can download the example from
the H-PaGe web site, and modify it here and there.

<h2>Getting started</h2>
Make sure that you have access to the server.
You can get information how to do it from
<!-- Link is given as <a href=""> name_that_appears_in_the_text </a> -->
<a href="http://www.oersted.dtu.dk/internal/access_and_use.html">
   http://www.oersted.dtu.dk/internal/access_and_use.html
</a>

Obtain a copy of "hpage". Place it some where
in your home directory on the oersted server.
A good place would be:
<pre>  <!--This is verbatim output -->
 /home/your_initials/2www/hpage
</pre>
Create a file called <tt>index.php</tt>
in the directory where you want to have
your website. Let's say that it will be
<pre>
http://www.oersted.dtu.dk/personal/your_initials
</pre>
then the file must be located at
<pre>
/home/your_initials/2www/
</pre>
If you want to make a web site which is located at
<pre>
http://www.oersted.dtu.dk/personal/your_initials/tutorial/
</pre>
then <tt>index.php</tt> must reside in a directory:
<pre>
/home/your_initials/2www/tutorial
</pre>
The text of this file should be:
<pre>
&lt;?
  include_once('/home/your_initials/2www/hpage/index.php');
?&gt;
</pre>

Now you should be able to see something with your browser.
It will have the sine "Ørsted*DTU", and will be given in green.

<h2>Customizing your web site</h2>

<h3>Adding some content</h3>
Your first task is to provide some content to the web site.
Create a file called <tt>main.html</tt>, and place
it in the same directory, in which you created the file
<tt>index.php</tt>. Let the text in this file
be something like this:
<pre>
&lt;h1&gt; Welcome to my home page &lt;h1&gt;

This is my very first page with H-PaGe!
</pre>
You should see on the screen:<p><br>
<hr>
<h1> Welcome to my home page </h1>
    This is my very first page with H-PaGe!

<hr>
<p><br>
You can even write a simple text. Remember to
give an extension ".txt" to your file.
You can edit the file using some editor like
Netscape composer.
<b>Remember not to set any font sizes, colors,
etc. This is taken care of by H-Page</b>
<h3>Changing the looks</h3>
Your web site is green. You want it to be blue.
Here is what you have to do.
<p><br>
First create two directories: <tt>files</tt> and
<tt> pictures</tt>.
If you refresh the browser, then these two
directories would appear in the menu. They will
be sorted according to the time of <b>modification</b>.

<p><br>
Copy the file <tt><b>blue.css</b></tt> to the same
directory as <tt>index.php</tt>.
You can get it from  <a href="files/blue.css.txt"> here </a>.
Remember to remove any extension of type <tt>.txt</tt>.

<p><br>
Copy the file <tt><b>line_blue.gif</b></tt> to the subdirectory
<tt>pictures</tt>. You can place it in any other directory,
but it is nice to keep your files organized.
You can get it from  <a href="pictures/line_blue.gif"> here </a>.

<p><br>
In the same directory where you created <tt>index.php</tt>
create a text file called <tt><b>web.config</b></tt>. 
This file tells H-PaGe how you want your web 
site to look like - what colors and
pictures to use, and what items to have in the menu.
Your next step is to edit <tt>web.config</tt>. Write the
following
<pre>
&lt;?
   set_style('blue.css');
   add_image('menu_line','pictures/line_blue.gif','line');
?&gt;
</pre>

The first line tells H-PaGe to use blue colors (the style sheet blue.css).
The second line tells H-PaGe to use the file <tt>pictures/line_blue.gif</tt>
as an underlining line for the menu. Notice that what you are doing
is essentially to call functions from H-PaGe. Remember always the
semicolon at the end of the line. Remember that all 
the command must between <tt><b>&lt?</b></tt> and <tt><b>?&gt</b></tt>.

<p><br>
Now we want to add the images.
<ul>
<li>
	 Download the upper left image from 
	 <a href="pictures/decoration_ul_blue.gif">here</a>
</li>
<li>
	 Download the upper right image from 
	 <a href="pictures/dtu_logo_ur_blue.png">here</a> (DTU logo).
</li>
<li>
	 Create your own sign by clicking 
	 <a href="http://www.oersted.dtu.dk/personal/sn/hpage/?./create_logos/middleright_image.html">here</a>.<br>
	 Call it <tt>tutorial_logo_blue.png</tt>.<br>
	 You can download the one used on this
	 page from <a href="pictures/tutorial_logo_blue.png">here</a>.

</li>
</ul>
Add the following lines to your <tt>web.config</tt> file.
<pre>
  add_image('upperleft', 'pictures/decoration_ul_blue.gif', 'Decoration');
  add_image('upperright', 'pictures/dtu_logo_ur_blue.png', 'DTU');
  add_image('middleright', 'pictures/tutorial_logo_blue.png', 'Tutorial');
</pre>

<p><br>
One think you have noticed, is that when you click on the menu items
"files" and "pictures", there is nothing in them. You need 
to place a file called "main.html" in each od these directories.

<p><br>
If you want to place a link to one of the files that appear 
in the menus, you can do it like this:
<pre>
<a href="?files/">&lt;a href="?files/"&gt;&nbsp;files &nbsp; &lt;/a&gt; </a>
</pre>
The question marc (?) means that what follows is a parameter for the 
program <tt>index.php</tt>. What you have to give after is a path 
to the file you want view. The path is relative to the directory
in which <tt>index.php</tt> is placed. If the file you want to 
view is not called <tt>main</tt>, then you must specify the name of the file
last. If it is called <tt>main</tt>, then the directory path is enough. 
If you have only directories, the last symbol must be slash (/).
