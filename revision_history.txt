REVISION HISTORY:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Revision A, June 2002, SN.
    Full functionality. Setup parameters in different files.
    
(2) Revision B, 29 Nov 2002, CS
    Menu items and picture definitions from a single file "web.config"
    as suggested by JAJ
    
(3) Revision B-1 29 Nov 2002, SN
   (3.1) Fixed problem with two "Home" entries.
   (3.2) Fixed problem with the line bw items
   (3.3) Decoupled the "navigation" class from the 
         "menu, leftmenu, and bottommenu".
         The "navigation" does not contain information
         about the "background color". This is because
         one risks to have links with dark colors
         over a light background.
         
   (3.4) Now the cascaded style sheets have the following
         names:
         topmenu - For the top part of the menu
         leftmenu - For the left part of the menu 
         bottomenu - For the bottom menu
         banner - For the text on the bottom
         contents - For the text shown in the "contents" part
                    of the page.
                             
         the outer table has a new CSS - "border".
         
   (3.5) The sub-menus created from the directory 
         structure have the correct position of lines.
         
   (3.6) Added a new type of picture in "web.config"
       add_image('menu_line','groenlinje.gif','Line');
       This for the line displayed between two menu items.
       
       
(4) Revision B-2, 9 Dec 2002 SN
   (4.1) Corrected the CSS style sheet. Now the colors
         of the background can be changed from CSS.
   (4.2) Removed the borders in the pictures when linking.

   (4.3) Changed the behaviour of the function "add_menu".
         Now the function differentiates between
         absolute web addresses and realitve addresses.
         In the case of a relative address, the 
         arguments to "index.php" are automatically
         appended.
         
      NOW THE PROGRAM  WORKS AS IN VERSION A
      
(5) Revision B-3, 16 Dec 2002, SN
   (5.1) Fixed the problem with the space below the 
         pictures. (extra new line in the forming of the
         link in the function "add_image()")
   
   (5.2) Fixed a problem with the extra white border 
         at the edges. Problem was debugged by MYP.
         
   (5.3) Suggestion by Allan Jørgensen for no-lines when
         menus are separated is implemented.   
   (5.4) Fixed the problem with topics in the top and bottom menus.
   
   (5.5) Added "Printer Friendly Version"

(6) Revision B-4, 17 Dec 2002, AJ, SN
    (6.1) SN fixed a potential problem with titles.
   
    (6.2) AJ added a function for replacing characters with 
          special characters in the menu names. This feature
          is controlled from "web.config" with the function
          set_sub('true' | 'false');
    (6.3) If there is no upper-right image, then the title
          of the page is printed instead.
         
(7) Revision B-5, 18 Dec 2002,  SN
    (7.1) Added "Last Updated text"
    (7.2) Modifications to the BODY part of the CSS. 
          Font-family, size, color.
    (7.3) Wrote a utility for making the titles using PHP
    (7.4) New function "show_updated()" in "web.config"
    (7.5) Added the possibility for a "bottom text", 
          which appears instead of the bottom menu.
    (7.6) Added automatic printing from the left menu.
    (7.7) Added "web.addconfig" allowing to have different
          setting for different $item(s)

(8) Revision B-6, 19 Dec 2002, SN
    (8.1) Now if the menu specifies a path to a directory, in which
          there is a "index.php", the address which is formed is 
          a full address to that PHP script.
          
(9)  Revision B-7 03 Jan 2003, SN
     (9.1) The script now detects Netscape 4.x. In this case, the outer
           most table has a borderwidth of "1".
     (9.2) Fixed a problem for the display of a horizontal menu. In 
           Netscape 4.x, the default value for a table border is "1".
           Now it is explicitly set to 0.
      
(10) Revision B-8 07 Jan 2003, SN
     (10.1) Modified the CSS files. Now the links change their 
            color when the cursor moves over them. 
            The following CSS styles exist:
            red.css, green.css, blue.css, 
            lila.css, brown.css, cyan.css
     (10.2) Added support for "*.txt" files. If a "main.txt" 
            exists, or the topic refers to a ".txt" file, 
            then the contents of  that file is read within a 
            pair of "&lt;pre&gt;" and "&lt;/pre&gt;" tags.
   

(11) Revision B-9 14 Jan 2003, SN
     (11.1) Added support for global paths, starting with "~/"
     (11.2) Added forms for creating an Upper- and Middle- Right images.
 
(12) Revision B-10 15 Jan 2003, SN
     (12.1) Added a new command called "set_home_text()" which 
            changes the text in the "Home link".
      
(13) Revision B-11 15 Jan 2003, SN
     (13.1) Text files are parsed for HTML tags.
     (13.2) Fixed CSS styles for normal TABLES.

(15) Revision B-13 21 Jan 2003, SN
   (15.1) Bug fixes in the sub-menus functions. 

(16) Revision C-1, 08 July 2003, SN
     Completely rewritten.
     New features:
     (16.1) Sorting of directory names in the menu. 
            Alphabetically or by date.
     (16.2) New style - current
     (16.4) New engine for the the menus
     (16.5) New links. Now the user can specify the link from 
            the document by using only 
            "?directory/subidrector/file_name.extension"
      (16.6) File extensions are obligatory in the
             "add_menu" command.
             
             If skipped, funny things can happen.
             
(16) Revision C-2, 19 August 2003, SN
    Added a function for reading tables "read_file_tables". 
    The file must have an extension .table
    You can define table as follows:
    A table starts with 
    <hpage_table>
      and ends with
    </hpage_table>
   
     Every new row is on a new line
     Every new cell is separated from the other cell with "&&"
     The first row is shown with very dark background.
     The rest of the rows are shown in alternating light and
     dark backgrounds.
   
     Example:
   
     <h1>This is a calender</h1>


     <hpage_table>
     No    &&     Dato   &&     Emne    &&      Litteratur      
     1     &&   15 Sep   &&   One   && Whenever     
     2     &&   25 Dec   &&   Two     && That is cool 
     3     &&   25 Dec   &&   Three     && That is cool
     4     &&   25 Dec   &&   What the hell     && That is cool
     5     &&   25 Dec   &&   What the hell     && That is cool
     </hpage_table>
